Currently pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience, studying binaural integration of sound in the auditory brainstem. Our lab studies how the Medial Superior Olive (MSO), historically thought to consist of a single neuron type, may contain a broad diversity of firing phenotypes. These non-canonical firing types have properties inconsistent with those necessary for temporal precision and binaural integration.

We are using hearing impaired and pre-hearing models to study what drives neuron diversity on a genetic and molecular level through oatch-clamp physiology, immunohistochemistry, and RNA-seq techniques.
